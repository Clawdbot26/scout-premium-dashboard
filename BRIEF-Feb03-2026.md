## 📈 INVESTMENT BRIEF

### Market Context:
- Tech sector up 27.8% YTD (outpacing S&P 500's 20%)
- Nasdaq up 21% — strong momentum into 2026
- AI infrastructure spending accelerating (manufacturing, telecom, enterprise)
- Inflation contained, consumer resilience holding

### TOP 3 HIGH-CONVICTION PICKS (Strong Fundamentals + Technicals):

**1️⃣ Micron Technology (MU)** — Semiconductor Play
- Undervalued vs. peers despite strong AI infrastructure demand
- Memory/storage essential for AI buildout
- Catalysts: AI capex acceleration, datacenter upgrades

**2️⃣ Salesforce (CRM)** — Enterprise AI Leader
- Digital transformation spending accelerating
- AI integration (Einstein) becoming competitive necessity
- Reasonable valuation relative to growth

**3️⃣ Applied Materials (AMAT)** — Semiconductor Equipment
- Direct beneficiary of AI chip manufacturing ramp
- Strong order book visibility
- Capital equipment cycle positive

**WILDCARD:** Tesla (TSLA)
- Driverless Model Y testing underway (Austin)
- Analyst price target: $800 (significant upside)
- Risk/reward compelling if autonomy proof point succeeds

**Action:** Review your $200k portfolio allocation — likely underweight on AI infrastructure plays.
