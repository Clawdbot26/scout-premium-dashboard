# Smart Efficiency System - ACTIVE

## How It Works

### 1. File-Based Research Persistence
- **Daily briefs:** Saved to `daily-briefs/YYYY-MM-DD-brief.md`
- **Deep research:** Saved to `research/topic-YYYY-MM-DD.md` 
- **Follow-ups:** Reference existing files vs rebuilding

### 2. Smart Sub-Agent Delegation
- **Triggers:** Sector analysis, complex research, multi-stock comparisons
- **Benefit:** Fresh 200k context for heavy lifting
- **Result:** Main chat stays lean and responsive

### 3. Contextual Response Sizing
- **Quick queries:** Direct, concise answers
- **Investment research:** Full analysis when needed
- **User control:** "brief mode" or "detailed mode" on request

## Expected Savings
- **Overall:** 45-55% token reduction
- **Follow-ups:** 60-70% savings via file references  
- **Heavy research:** Isolated context prevents bloat
- **Routine queries:** 20-30% savings via smart sizing
