### Premium Investment Intelligence Dashboard (High Priority)
**Status:** Core product complete (51KB HTML); ready for phase 2 (charts + interactivity)  
**File:** `/Users/clawdbot/.openclaw/workspace/dashboard-premium.html`

**Vision:** SaaS investment intelligence platform ($250-400/month) with real Yahoo Finance data, 20 premium features, professional dark theme, mobile-responsive.

**Current Focus:**
- Top 7 highest-conviction stocks (Value Score 7.0+): PLTR, CRM, AMAT, ASML, NVDA, AVGO, MRVL
- Watchlist: AMD (6.8), COHR (6.5) — monitoring for 7.0+ threshold
- All prices/fundamentals from Yahoo Finance (Feb 3, 2026 snapshot)

**Core Features Implemented:**
- Valuation comparisons vs peers + fair value estimates
- Risk dashboards (beta, volatility, max drawdown)
- Sentiment analysis (analyst %, insider, social tone)
- Earnings forecast + surprise history + CEO quotes
- Options activity, catalyst calendar, short interest tracking
- Management quality + competitive positioning scores
- Sector rotation scorecard + watchlist for emerging picks
- Professional badge tags + visual indicators
- Mobile-responsive glassmorphism design (dark theme, cyan/lime accents)

**Locked Design System:**
```
Gradient: #0a0e27 → #1a1a3e → #0f0f1e
Cyan: #00d4ff | Green: #00ff88 | Warning: #ffaa00 | Red: #ff4444
Cards: rgba(30,30,60,0.5) + backdrop blur
```

**Next Phases:**
1. Live price charts (Chart.js candlesticks, support/resistance, moving averages)
2. Interactive UI (expandable cards, sortable tables, metric filters, toggle views)
3. PDF export (daily/weekly reports)
4. Deployment (shareable URL, live data integration)
5. Real-time feeds + email alerts
6. Auth/subscription tier gating (SaaS)

**Key Decisions:**
- Public-facing only (no personal entry/exit prices)
- "Strong Buy"/"Accumulate" professional language
- Real data commitment (Yahoo Finance, no synthetic)
- All 20 features built as cohesive product, not phased
